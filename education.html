            <h5>Middle School</h5>
            <p>The middle school that I attended from 2010 to 2019 is called
            "Blazhe Koneski" and is located in Prilep. I had some of the best
            moments there and got my very first friends for lifetime. I was an excellent
            student, which helped me enroll in high school. </p>

            <h5>High School</h5>
            <p>The high school that I attended from 2019 to 2023 is called
                Gimnazija "Mirche Acev", also located in Prilep. Sadly, due to the globally spread
                virus, I only went there for 2 years - physically and the other 2 years we had online classes.
                Once again, I was a straight A's student which opened the doors to a good university for me.

            <h5>University</h5>
            <p>Currently, I attend the "Ss. Cyril and Methodius" University in Skopje,
                more precisely the faculty of information sciences and computer engineering. I am at the
                end of first year as a student, and I can say that it is everything i have expected from it,
                with a little surprises.</p>
